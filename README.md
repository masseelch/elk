## Important

The OpenAPI Specification generator is now part of [ent/contrib](https://github.com/ent/contrib/tree/master/entoas). The
OAS generator API has changed as has the generated spec. However, this package will follow the changes done in the OAS
generator and eventually behave as described by the spec.

---

This package provides an extension to the [awesome entgo.io](https://github.com/ent/ent) code generator.

`elk` can do two things for you:

1. Generate a fully compliant, extendable [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3.html)
   specification file to enable you to make use of the [Swagger Tooling](https://swagger.io/tools/) to generate RESTful
   server stubs and clients.
2. Generate a ready-to-use and extendable server implementation of the OpenAPI specification. The code generated
   by `elk` uses the Ent ORM while maintaining complete type-safety and leaving reflection out of sight.

> :warning: **This is work in progress**: The API may change without further notice!

This package depends on [Ent](https://entgo.io), an ORM project for Go. To learn more about Ent, how to connect to
different types of databases, run migrations or work with entities head over to
their [documentation](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started).

## Getting Started

The first step is to add the `elk` package to your project:

```shell
go get github.com/masseelch/elk
```

`elk` uses the Ent [Extension API](https://entgo.io/docs/extensions) to integrate with Entâ€™s code-generation. This
requires that we use the `entc` (ent codegen) package as
described [here](https://entgo.io/docs/code-gen#use-entc-as-a-package). Follow the next four steps to enable it and to
configure Ent to work with the `elk` extension:

1. Create a new Go file named `ent/entc.go` and paste the following content:

```go
// +build ignore

package main

import (
	"log"

	"entgo.io/ent/entc"
	"entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
)

func main() {
	ex, err := elk.NewExtension(
		elk.GenerateSpec("openapi.json"),
		elk.GenerateHandlers(),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("creating elk extension: %v", err)
	}
	err = entc.Generate("./schema", &gen.Config{}, entc.Extensions(ex))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("running ent codegen: %v", err)
	}
}

```

2. Edit the `ent/generate.go` file to execute the `ent/entc.go` file:

```go
package ent

//go:generate go run -mod=mod entc.go

```

3. _(Only required if server generation is enabled)_ `elk` uses some external packages in its generated code. Currently,
   you have to get those packages manually once when setting up `elk`:

```shell
go get github.com/mailru/easyjson github.com/go-chi/chi/v5 go.uber.org/zap
```

4. Run the code generator:

```shell
go generate ./...
```

In addition to the files Ent would normally generate, another directory named `ent/http` and a file named `openapi.json`
was created. The `ent/http` directory contains the code for the `elk`-generated HTTP CRUD handlers while `openapi.json`
contains the OpenAPI Specification. Feel free to have a look
at [this example spec file](https://github.com/masseelch/elk/tree/master/internal/simple/ent/openapo.json)
and [the implementing server code](https://github.com/masseelch/elk/tree/master/internal/simple/ent/http).

If you want to generate a client matching the spec as well, you can user the following function and call it after
generating the spec in `entc.go`

```go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	"github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/pkg/codegen"
	"github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/pkg/util"
)

func generateClient() {
	swagger, err := util.LoadSwagger("./openapi.json")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to load swagger %v", err)
	}

	generated, err := codegen.Generate(swagger, "stub", codegen.Options{
		GenerateClient: true,
		GenerateTypes:  true,
		AliasTypes:     true,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("generaring client failed %s", err);
	}

	dir := filepath.Join(".", "stub")
	stub := filepath.Join(".", "stub", "http.go")
	perm := os.FileMode(0777)
	if err := os.MkdirAll(dir, perm); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error creating dir: %s", err)
	}

	if err := ioutil.WriteFile(stub, []byte(generated), perm); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error writing generated code to file: %s", err)
	}
}
```

### Setting up a server

This section guides you to a very simple setup for an `elk`-powered Ent. The following two files define the two schemas
Pet and User with a Many-To-One relation: A Pet belongs to a User, and a User can have multiple Pets.

***ent/schema/pet.go***

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
)

// Pet holds the schema definition for the Pet entity.
type Pet struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the Pet.
func (Pet) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.String("name"),
	}
}

// Edges of the Pet.
func (Pet) Edges() []ent.Edge {
	return []ent.Edge{
		edge.From("owner", User.Type).
			Ref("pets").
			Unique(),
	}
}
```

***ent/schema/user.go***

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
)

// User holds the schema definition for the User entity.
type User struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the User.
func (User) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.String("name"),
	}
}

// Edges of the User.
func (User) Edges() []ent.Edge {
	return []ent.Edge{
		edge.To("pets", Pet.Type),
	}
}
```

After regenerating the code you can spin up a runnable server with the below `main` function:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"<your-project>/ent"
	elk "<your-project>/ent/http"

	"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5"
	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
	"go.uber.org/zap"
)

func main() {
	// Create the ent client. This opens up a sqlite file named elk.db.
	c, err := ent.Open("sqlite3", "./elk.db?_fk=1")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed opening connection to sqlite: %v", err)
	}
	defer c.Close()
	// Run the auto migration tool.
	if err := c.Schema.Create(context.Background()); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed creating schema resources: %v", err)
	}
	// Start listen to incoming requests.
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", elk.NewHandler(c, zap.NewExample())); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Start the server:

```shell
go run -mod=mod main.go
```

Congratulations! You now have a running server serving the Pets API. The database is still empty though. the following
two curl requests create a new user and adds a pet, that belongs to that user.

```shell
curl -X 'POST' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Elk"}' 'localhost:8080/users'
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Elk"
}
```

```shell
curl -X 'POST' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Kuro","owner":1}' 'localhost:8080/pets'
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Kuro"
}
```

The response data on the creation operation does not include the User the new Pet belongs to. `elk` does not include
edges in its output by default. You can configure `elk` to render edges using a feature called **serialization groups**.

## Serialization Groups

`elk` by default includes every field of a schema in an endpoints output and excludes fields. This behaviour can be
changed by using **serialization groups**. You can configure `elk` what **serialization groups** to request on what
endpoint using a `elk.SchemaAnnotation`. With a `elk.Annotation` you configure what fields and edges to include. `elk`
follows the following rules to determine if a field or edge is included or not:

- If no groups are requested all fields are included and all edges are excluded
- If a group x is requested all fields with no groups and fields with group x are included. Edges with x are eager
  loaded and rendered.

Change the previously mentioned schemas and add **serialization groups**:

***ent/schema/pet.go***

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
)

// Pet holds the schema definition for the Pet entity.
type Pet struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the Pet.
func (Pet) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.String("name"),
	}
}

// Edges of the Pet.
func (Pet) Edges() []ent.Edge {
	return []ent.Edge{
		edge.From("owner", User.Type).
			Ref("pets").
			Unique().
			// render this edge if one of 'pet:read' or 'pet:list' is requested.
			Annotations(elk.Groups("pet:read", "pet:list")),
	}
}

// Annotations of the Pet.
func (Pet) Annotations() []schema.Annotation {
	return []schema.Annotation{
		// Request the 'pet:read' group when rendering the entity after creation.
		elk.CreateGroups("pet:read"),
		// You can request several groups per endpoint.
		elk.ReadGroups("pet:list", "pet:read"),
	}
}
```

***ent/schema/user.go***

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
)

// User holds the schema definition for the User entity.
type User struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the User.
func (User) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.String("name").
			// render this field only if no groups or the 'owner:read' groups is requested.
			Annotations(elk.Groups("owner:read")),
	}
}

// Edges of the User.
func (User) Edges() []ent.Edge {
	return []ent.Edge{
		edge.To("pets", Pet.Type),
	}
}
```

After regenerating the code and restarting the server `elk` renders the owner if you create a new pet.

```shell
curl -X 'POST' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Martha","owner":1}' 'localhost:8080/pets'
```

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Martha",
  "owner": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Elk"
  }
}
```

## Validation

`elk` supports the [validation](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-fields#validators) feature of Ent. For demonstration extend
the above Pet schema:

```go
package schema

import (
	"errors"
	"strings"

	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
)

// Pet holds the schema definition for the Pet entity.
type Pet struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Fields of the Pet.
func (Pet) Fields() []ent.Field {
	return []ent.Field{
		field.Int("age").
			// Validator will only be called if the request body has a 
			// non nil value for the field 'age'.
			Optional().
			// Works for built-in validators.
			Positive(),
		field.String("name").
			// Works for built-in validators.
			MinLen(3).
			// Works for custom validators.
			Validate(func(s string) error {
				if strings.ToLower(s) == s {
					return errors.New("name must begin with uppercase")
				}
				return nil
			}),
		// Enums are validated against the allowed values.
		field.Enum("color").
			Values("red", "blue", "green", "yellow"),
	}
}

// Edges of the Pet.
func (Pet) Edges() []ent.Edge {
	return []ent.Edge{
		edge.From("owner", User.Type).
			Ref("pets").
			Unique().
			// Works with edge validation.
			Required().
			// render this edge if one of 'pet:read' or 'pet:list' is requested.
			Annotations(elk.Groups("pet:read", "pet:list")),
	}
}

// Annotations of the Pet.
func (Pet) Annotations() []schema.Annotation {
	return []schema.Annotation{
		// Request the 'pet:read' group when rendering the entity after creation.
		elk.CreateGroups("pet:read"),
		// You can request several groups per endpoint.
		elk.ReadGroups("pet:list", "pet:read"),
	}
}
```

## Sub Resources

`elk` provides first level sub resource handlers for all your entities. With previously set up server, run the
following:

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080/pets/1/owner'
```

You'll get information about the Owner of the Pet with the id 1. `elk` uses `elk.SchemaAnnotation.ReadGroups` for a
unique edge and `elk.SchemaAnnotation.ListGroups` for a non-unique edge.

## Pagination

`elk` paginates all list endpoints. This is valid for both resource and sub-resources routes.

```shell
curl 'localhost:8080/pets?page=2&itemsPerPage=1'
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Martha"
  }
]
```

## Configuration

`elk` lets you decide what endpoints you want it to generate by the use of **generation policies**. You can either
expose all routes by default and hide some you are not interested in or exclude all routes by default and only expose
those you want generated:

***ent/entc.go***

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"entgo.io/ent/entc"
	"entgo.io/ent/entc/gen"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk/policy"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk/spec"
)

func main() {
	ex, err := elk.NewExtension(
		elk.GenerateSpec("openapi.json"),
		elk.GenerateHandlers(),
		// Exclude all routes by default.
		elk.DefaultHandlerPolicy(elk.Exclude),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("creating elk extension: %v", err)
	}
	err = entc.Generate("./schema", &gen.Config{}, entc.Extensions(ex))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("running ent codegen: %v", err)
	}
}

```

***ent/schema/user.go***

```go
package schema

import (
	"entgo.io/ent"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/edge"
	"entgo.io/ent/schema/field"
	"github.com/masseelch/elk"
)

// User holds the schema definition for the User entity.
type User struct {
	ent.Schema
}

// Annotations of the User.
func (User) Annotations() []schema.Annotation {
	return []schema.Annotation{
		// Generate creation and read endpoints.
		elk.Expose(elk.Create, elk.Read),
	}
}
```

For more information about how to configure `elk` and what it can do have a look at
the [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/masseelch/elk) [integration test setup](https://github.com/masseelch/elk/tree/master/internal)
.

## Known Issues and Outlook

- `elk` does currently only work with JSON. It is relatively easy to support XML as well and there are plans to provide
  conditional XML / JSON parsing and rendering based on the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers.

- The generated code does not have very good automated tests yet.

## Contribution

`elk` has not reach its first release yet but the API can be considered somewhat stable. I welcome any suggestion or
feedback and if you are willing to help I'd be very glad. The [issues tab](https://github.com/masseelch/elk/issues) is a
wonderful place for you to reach out for help, feedback, suggestions and contribution.
